								<h3>Why Choose It?</h3>
								<p>Chiropractic is the method of natural healing most chosen by those seeking complementary and/or alternative health care for acute and chronic conditions.</p>
								<p>While you may first visit a chiropractor to relieve pain in the lower back or to treat sciatica, neck pain, whiplash or headache, you will find that a chiropractor views you as a whole person and not the sum of your parts. A chiropractor will
									work in partnership with you to ensure your optimal health and wellness.</p>
								<h3>Triggers your body’s ability to heal</h3>
								<p>Chiropractors recognize that many factors affect your health, including exercise, nutrition, sleep, environment and heredity. Chiropractic focuses on maintaining your health naturally to help your body resist disease, rather than simply treating
									the symptoms of disease.</p>
								<h3>Starts with a thorough evaluation</h3>
								<p>When you visit a Doctor of Chiropractic, you will be evaluated using time-honored methods, including consultation, case history, physical examination, laboratory analysis and X-ray examination. In addition, you will receive a careful chiropractic
									structural examination, with particular attention paid to the spine.</p>
								<h3>Involves no drugs or surgery</h3>
								<p>A broad range of techniques are used to locate, analyze and gently correct vertebral misalignments (subluxations) in the spine. Chiropractors may use manual adjustment, electrical muscular stimulation, ultrasound or massage. But they never use
									pharmaceutical drugs or invasive surgery. Chiropractic is a natural method of healing that stimulates the body&#8217;s communication system to work more effectively to initiate, control and coordinate the various functions of the cells, organs
									and systems of the body.</p>
								<h3>Partners with other healthcare professionals</h3>
								<p>Doctors of chiropractic work in tandem with other healthcare professionals. If your condition requires attention from another branch of the healthcare profession, that recommendation or referral will be made.</p>
