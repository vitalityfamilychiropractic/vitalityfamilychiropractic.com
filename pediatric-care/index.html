								<h3>Children&#8217;s Chiropractic Safety Research:</h3>
								<p align="left">The International Chiropractic Pediatric Association (ICPA) has initiated a ground breaking study on the safety and effectiveness of chiropractic care for children. The preliminary results are outstanding and show that chiropractic care is safe
									for children. Even more significant is that parents reported three unexpected improvements with their child&#8217;s care:</p>
								<ol>
									<li>Improved sleeping</li>
									<li>Improved behavior and attitude</li>
									<li>Improved immune system function</li>
								</ol>

								<p><b>Immunity:</b><span class="text style4"><br />
Author Katie Gilbert authored a great article, </span>Immune Boost: This is a Spinal Zap covering how immune function is greatly improved with regular chiropractic care. it was published in <span class="text style4">Psychology Today.</span></p>
								<p><i>Interesting to note was this paragraph on the flu:</i></p>
								<blockquote>
									<p>Chiropractic care was first linked to improved immunity during the deadly flu epidemic of 1917 and 1918. The funny thing was: Chiropractic patients fared better than the general population. This observation spurred a study of the field. The data
										reported that flu victims under chiropractic care had an estimated .25 percent death rate, a lot less than the normal rate of 5 percent among flu victims who did not receive chiropractic care. <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/articles/200608/immune-boost-is-spinal-zap"
