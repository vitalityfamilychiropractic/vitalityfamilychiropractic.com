## Family Wellness Care

There are many reasons people choose to visit a chiropractor.  At Vitality Family Chiropractic, people choose to visit for two main reasons:

#### They are healthy and want to stay healthy

Your nervous system controls everything in your body.  Making sure it is working without interference from the spine is very important.  Without normal nervous system function, your body simply won’t work properly.  That means your immune system, digestive system, musculoskeletal system, and every other part of your body will be affected.  Many families choose to use chiropractic care as a safe and natural approach to keeping their nervous system functioning properly so they can be as healthy as possible.  

#### They are sick and tired of being sick and tired

Many people come to Vitality Family Chiropractic because they have some health challenge and are seeking an alternative to drugs and surgery.  While most people are aware of using chiropractic for neck pain, back pain, sciatica, migraines, and headaches, many people visit us with other challenges like sleeping problems, digestive disorders, anxiety, high blood pressure, infertility, fibromyalgia, menstrual pain ,and autoimmune conditions. If you fall into this group- someone who wants to be healthier but struggles with a pain or health challenge, then chiropractic may be a great option!  By adjusting the spine, chiropractors help restore normal nervous system function so the body can regulate and heal itself.  At Vitality Family Chiropractic, we’ve had many practice members see great changes in various aspects of their health following chiropractic adjustments.
