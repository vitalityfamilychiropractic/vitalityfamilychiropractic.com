## Pregnancy Care

Chiropractic is concerned with the structural relationship between the spine, pelvis, and nervous system. During pregnancy a woman’s body undergoes dramatic changes structurally, chemically (hormones), and emotionally.  Chiropractic can help make pregnancy more comfortable, more enjoyable, and prepare the body for an easier and safer birth. 

The body experiences very rapid changes during pregnancy (increased weight gain, change in posture, and hormones which relax stabilizing ligaments).  The changes are vital for growth and arrival of baby, but they can also interfere with other areas of life.  Common secondary conditions from this shift include aches  and pain (lower back pain, sciatica, pubic bone pain, symphysis pubis dysfunction, tailbone pain, etc), digestive disorders (reflux, heartburn, constipation, etc), overall wellness (fatigue, sleep, mood swings, etc), and even disruptions of normal birth (baby’s position, onset of labor, and progression of labor). 

Chiropractic care is a gentle, non-invasive approach to correction and stabilizing the spine and pelvis.  Completely safe throughout pregnancy, chiropractic care helps the body work better and ultimately, improves quality of life and potentially birth outcomes.  We have hundreds of patients tell us that chiropractic care made their pregnancy more enjoyable and their birth shorter and easier.  

After baby arrives, chiropractic is used to help the body recover and adapt to the new physical and emotional challenges of motherhood.  Most of our moms also get baby checked to determine if chiropractic can help with development and challenges like breastfeeding, digestion, comfort, sleep, and immune function. 

The [International Chiropractic Pediatric Association’s website](http://www.icpa4kids.com/) is a great resource, filled with research and articles that further explain the important role chiropractic plays in prenatal care.  Dr. Christie is certified in the Webster technique and has extensive training and clinical experience working with pregnant women.
