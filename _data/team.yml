    biography: >-
      Dr. Christie received her Doctor of Chiropractic Degree from Palmer College of Chiropractic in Port Orange, FL in 2011.  
      She also holds a degree in Biomedical Sciences from Auburn University.  She has received advanced training in spinal 
      correction, toxicity, exercise and nutrition from some of the largest health care clinics in the world in Denver, Chicago, 
      and The Woodlands, TX.  

      Dr. Christie’s deepest passion lies in taking care of families, specifically pregnant women and children.  She knows that 
      her greatest impact can be made by teaching children to take care of their bodies from birth.  Her youngest patients get 
      adjusted soon after birth- some merely an hour old.  Her vision is to see a world where people and families achieve abundant 
      health and are living up to their God-given potential.  Dr. Christie is a member of the ICPA, is certified in the Webster 
      Technique, and holds a board certification from The Council of Chiropractic Pediatrics of The Academy of Chiropractic Family 
      Practice (CACCP).  She has had advanced training in chiropractic cranial corrections and is actively pursuing her Pediatric 
      SOT certification.  

      Dr. Christie moved to the Brazos Valley in 2011 and enjoys life here with her husband Nick and daughter Mackenzie.  Her husband 
      Nick serves as the Deputy Chief Information Security Officer for the Texas A&M University System and Mackenzie is in third grade. 
      In her free time she likes to travel, play pickleball, cook, craft, read, and spend time with her family.

      Dr. Christie’s favorite part of being a chiropractor is the relationships she builds with her patients.  Being a wellness chiropractor 
      allows for us to get to know each other in a way that  resembles a friendship more than a doctor-patient relationship.  

      Dr. Christie loves supporting local businesses and “doing life” with her patients and their businesses.  She is available for lunch and 
      learn presentations, corporate wellness programs on site, and is always excited to serve as needed in the community.   

      Please reach out if you feel we could be of service in any way.
