### What is Pathways Connect?

Pathways Connect of the Brazos Valley, hosted by Vitality Family Chiropractic, is a gathering group and educational outreach program connecting practitioners with local families. The focus of the group is empowering parents and discussing the emerging paradigm of Vitalism, Wholism and Innate Intelligence through the resources of Pathways to Family Wellness magazine.

Pathways Connect of the Brazos Valley meets monthly to discuss articles that are presented in the Pathways magazine. The articles are determined by group request. (Please let us know what your interests are and what articles you want covered)

We will be bringing experts to the meetings to help with the discussion and to answer any questions the group has.

Through this connection, families will find the information and support they need for making informed health and conscious living choices as well as meeting and connecting with other like-minded families. This connection is the greatest benefit	of Pathways Connect!

Pathways Connect of the Brazos Valley meets on the last Thursday of every month at 6:15 PM at Vitality Family Chiropractic. For more information about the gathering group email us at [info@vitalityfamilychiropractic.com](mailto:info@vitalityfamilychiropractic.com) or visit our Facebook page.
